     <p>Welcome to My Portfolio
        Hello! I’m Suman Kumar Manjhi, a passionate and creative Graphics Designer and Web Developer with a keen eye for detail and a love for innovative design. With a background in crafting visually stunning graphics and developing seamless web experiences, I bring a unique blend of artistic flair and technical proficiency to every project.
        
        What I Do:
        
        Graphics Design: From eye-catching logos and engaging social media visuals to sophisticated branding materials, I specialize in creating designs that captivate and communicate effectively.
        Web Development: I build dynamic, responsive websites that not only look great but also provide an intuitive user experience. My approach is focused on marrying aesthetic appeal with functionality.
        I believe in the power of design to tell compelling stories and drive impactful user experiences. My goal is to help businesses and individuals express their unique identity through thoughtful and effective design solutions.
